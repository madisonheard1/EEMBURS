- Number and type of particants (talk vs poster vs attendee/breakdown of participants)
- demographic info (Tori question bc IRB -- can we use demo data from year 1?)

-" What were the demographics of the students, and how many participated?"
  - "general discussion of the breakdown of who attended, even of the volunteers (were they a diverse cohort as well?) is needed here"


- " How did you recruit for the symposium? Was it open to anyone, or did you have an application form? Did you need to turn away anyone or whoever wanted to could participate?"
  - emailed listervs for undergraduates, partnered with labs and aksed grad students to encouraged
  - open to anyone with the link to the registration form, 
  - note how many different departments that had a participant
  - had an abstract submission form but no one was denied*
  -       reasons: (1) to have an idea of their presentation prior to the event and (2) to allow the planning committee to put together a program, (3) number of presentations \
  - encouraged students with projects related to either ecology, evolution and marine biology. 
        * One person was not permitted to present as their project did not relate to either of these three themes, but were encouraged to attend and to submit their abstract to the campus wide colloquium. Our event is different as it promotes networking within our department in a low stakes environment as the URCA SLAM is a high stress environment.

Broadly, what were your results? There should be a short section that in general terms lets readers know whether your symposium was a success and how you measured that success. 
      - a success (?) survey results that are inbound will help us answer this question
      - more students signed up during year 2 and that is an indirect metric of success             
                                    
                                      
How do you know students got anything out of it?
    - TESTIMONIALS INCOMING????
